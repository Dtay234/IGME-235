                Hi, I'm Dante. I think this class provides a great opportunity to learn new skills.
                When I'm doing hackathons with my friends, I'd like to be able to help them with the technical stuff and 
                HTML and CSS can let me do that. When I'm done with college I would like to have made a couple of my own 
                games.
                
            </p>
