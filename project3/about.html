    <h3>Proposal</h3>
    <p>Gravity Art</p>
    <p>Roll a ball to draw a generated shape. Use WASD to "tilt" the platform and roll the ball. Score higher the more accurate
        you are with the path.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Genre: Arcade</li>
        <li>Story: Abstract</li>
        <li>Aesthetics: Cartoony</li>
        <li>Gameplay: Player has to think fast and adjust the tilt of their platform to
             make sure they don't get too far off course. There will be instructions to teach the player how to play.</li>

    <h3>Development Process:</h3>
    <p>I began with making the ball controllable. This is the core of the game and it needed to work well. During this process I switched the controls from WASD to mouse.
        Using WASD to control the platform felt too easy, the point of this game is to have unweildy controls so it's more of a challenge. Next, I wanted to make the shapes. 
        I had to keep in mind how I wanted to do the scoring of the path, which made figuring out how to do it was pretty difficult. Since each point on the path and on the shape 
        are stored, I didn't want to just check each combination of points to see the distance between them, although I did end up doing something not too far off. 
        The hardest part of this project was making the platform look like it was tilting. I had a lot of work to do making it look like it was 3D. To do this I had to have blocks on each side
        that are constantly resized to look like the sides of the platform. I also had to scale the objects as well as the distance between them. However, I also had to figure out how to do this
        without messing up the logic, since it was changing the coordinates of each object every update. To fix this, I used an affine map to convert in between coordinate systems 
        for drawing and updating.
