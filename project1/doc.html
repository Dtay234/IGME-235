        <p style="width:50%">Goal: Show employers my skills and passion. I heard in IGME-99 from a guest speaker that the portfolio 
            says a lot about the person, so I tried to make mine well organized, with projects of different kinds on different pages.
            Employers will also be interested in which category (personal, professional, or class) a project falls into.

            <br><br>

            The hardest part about this page was the growing and shrinking project links with thumbnail images on the home page. It required 
            so much tweaking that I almost gave up on it. 

            <br><br>

            Note: While there is content not on the home page on the extra pages, it's basically just a short description that links to an external
            page for that project. I don't think having all of those on the home page would be good for the site content and navigation wise.
